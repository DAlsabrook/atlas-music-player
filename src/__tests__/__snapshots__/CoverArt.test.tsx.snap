          Lyrics
        </p>
        <p>
          [Verse]
The night whispers secrets we knew,
Under twilight's soft, velvet hue,
In a city painted in blue,
We danced 'round the truth we flew.

[Verse 2]
Lamp posts glow with memories sweet,
As shadows and dreams softly meet,
Every step we take is so fleet,
To the syncopated heartbeat.

[Chorus]
Our love's a gentle, wistful tune,
Like a rose in the midday bloom,
Though fleeting like a smoke plume,
It's a love that leaves no room.

[Verse 3]
Stars overhead wink their bright eye,
As the moon sighs a fond goodbye,
We'll let this moment, too, pass by,
In this melancholy sky.

[Bridge]
Blue echoes on the midnight air,
Love caressed with a tender flair,
Through the darkness, hearts laid bare,
In the silence, a fervent prayer.

[Chorus]
Our love's a gentle, wistful tune,
Like a rose in the midday bloom,
Though fleeting like a smoke plume,
It's a love that leaves no room.
